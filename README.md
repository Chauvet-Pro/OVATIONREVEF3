* Place the .chl file in the root directory of the USB drive.
* The product's USB port supports up to 32GB capacity and only works with FAT32 file format.
* Turning off the power or removing the USB while still blinking during the update will cause partial or total firmware failure in the targeted fixture(s). A force upload will be needed to fix firmware failure issues.

      * **Multiple Fixture** : Both the target fixture and main fixture are from the same product line (e.g., 2 Color STRIKE M fixtures).
      * **Other Fixture Type**: The target fixture and main fixture are from different product series (e.g., a Color STRIKE M as the target fixture and a Maverick Silens 2 Profile as the main fixture).
6.	Select the file that needs to be uploaded. The message ***“Are you sure?”*** will appear on the screen. Press **< ENTER >**. Turn on the target fixture within 1–2 seconds of pressing **< ENTER >**. The display on the target fixture should remain off.
